Welcome to Pydrus's documentation!
==================================
This package provides a Python implementation of the HYDRUS-1D unsaturated zone model developed by Šimůnek, J., M. Th. van Genuchten, and M. Šejna. More information on the HYDRUS-1D model is available here. This software is licenced under the GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE found here. The Pydrus code is developed by Raoul Collenteur, Giuseppe Brunetti and Matevz Vremec. With Pydrus, a HYDRUS-1D model can be created, calibrated and visualized through Python scripts, making it easy to adjust the model and providing a 100% reproducible workflow of your modeling process.
